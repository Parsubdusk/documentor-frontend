    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>DocuMentor was created by four college seniors who had to do a project for their Senior Design Class. They created a chatbot dedicated to diversity and inclusivity that could help people in underserved communities. They thought of a chatbot that would help anyone understand any document, what to do with it, and answer questions. From this idea, we give DocuMentor.</p>
